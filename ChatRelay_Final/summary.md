Project Name: ChatRelay

Goal: Create a production-ready Slack bot that forwards user messages to an AI chat backend and streams replies back to Slack in real-time.

Context: High-performance messaging in team collaboration environments, using Go for speed and reliability.

🛠️ Approach
Language: Go (Golang) – chosen for its speed, concurrency support, and tooling.

Architecture: Clean separation via cmd/, internal/, and config/.

Streaming: Supports SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time streaming to Slack.

Fallback: Graceful fallback to full JSON response if backend doesn't support SSE.

Slack Integration: Uses Slack Events API with Add-to-Slack OAuth flow.

Observability: Integrated OpenTelemetry for traces and structured logging.

Testing: Includes unit tests and integration tests.

Mock Backend: Simulates real backend for both SSE and full response testing.

Dockerized: Both bot and mock backend are containerized with Docker and Docker Compose.

⚙️ What Was Built
Slack Bot – Listens for messages and relays them.

Chat Backend Client – Handles both streaming and full replies.

Mock Backend – Simulates /v1/chat/stream and /v1/chat/full endpoints.

OpenTelemetry Setup – Adds tracing, logging, and metrics support.

OAuth Flow – Includes Slack app manifest and login flow boilerplate.

Unit Tests – Tests for message handlers and backend logic.

Integration Test – Verifies end-to-end message flow.

README.md, LICENSE, .env, .gitignore – Clean project packaging.

Docker Support – Easily deploy locally or in production.

📦 Outcome
✅ Fully functional and tested Slack bot for streaming chat backend interaction.

✅ Modular, clean, and extensible code structure.

✅ Local dev environment runs with docker-compose and mock backend.

✅ Production practices followed (env config, telemetry, clean commits).

✅ Ready for deployment, showcasing Go concurrency, Slack integration, and streaming response handling.
